# Real-Time Recommendation Engine for E-Commerce Platform


This is a software engineering project for an e-commerce platform to build batch and real-time data pipelines together with high-performance REST APIs to create a real-time recommendation engine. The REST API will be the source of two recommendation lists on the main page: browsing history and best seller products.

## Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to build a recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform that suggests products to users based on their browsing history and popular products in their categories. The recommendation engine should generate personalized and non-personalized recommendations for the user.

## Architecture

## Technology Stack
- Programming Languages: Python
- Data Storage: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Elasticsearch
- Data Processing: Apache Spark
- Orchestration: Apache Airflow
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- REST API Framework: FaspAPI
- Visualization: Streamlit
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Docker Compose



## Features
The recommendation engine has the following features:

- **Browsing History:** The API returns the last ten products viewed by a given user and sorted by view date. The API also has a functionality for users to delete a product from their history.

- **Best Seller Products:** The API recommends best seller products to the user based on their browsing history items. If the user has no browsing history, the API returns a general best seller product list without any filter.

- **Personalized Recommendation:** The API uses the browsing history of the user to extract categories and offers at most ten products based on these categories. The bestsellers of a category means top ten products of this category bought (last month) by the most distinct users.

- **Non-Personalized Recommendation:** If a user has no browsing history, the API gives the top ten products bought (last month) by the most distinct users without any filter.

## Technical Details
All of the applications are deployed as Docker containers Docker Compose is used to manage the lifecycle of the containers and orchestrate the communication between them. Each application performs a specific task, adhering to the microservices architecture principles and runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that the applications are decoupled and can be updated or replaced independently.


The main applications in the project are:

- **Clickstream Product View Producer App:** This app simulates user activity on the e-commerce platform by generating and publishing product view events to a Kafka topic. 

- **Stream Reader App:** This app reads the product view events from the Kafka topic, processes them in real-time using Apache Spark, and writes the result to Elasticsearch for further analysis. 

- **Batch Pipeline ETL Process:** This application performs batch processing of the data using Apache Airflow. It extracts data from a PostgreSQL database containing product, order, and order item information, transforms the data to calculate  general best-seller products and loads the result into a MySQL database. 

- **Recommendation Rest API:** This app provides a REST API endpoint for generating personalized and non-personalized product recommendations. It retrieves data from the MySQL database generated by the Batch Pipeline ETL Process and Elasticsearch database generated by the Stream Reader App. 

- **Dashboard App:** This app provides a Streamlit dashboard for visualizing the recommendations generated by the Recommendation Rest API.
